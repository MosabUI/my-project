To pull changes from a GitHub repository to your local machine, you can use the git pull command. This is typically done when there have been new commits made to the remote repository, and you want to update your local copy of the code. Here's how to do it:

Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

Navigate to Your Local Repository:
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your local Git repository is located.

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/repo
Pull Changes from GitHub:
Run the following command to pull changes from the remote GitHub repository into your local repository:

bash
Copy code
git pull origin master
origin is the default name for the remote repository.
master is the name of the branch you want to pull changes from. If you're working with a different branch, replace "master" with the appropriate branch name.
If you've configured SSH keys or are using a personal access token, you won't be prompted for your GitHub credentials during the pull.

Review the Changes:
Git will fetch the changes from GitHub and merge them into your local branch if necessary. It will also display information about the changes that were pulled, such as new commits.
